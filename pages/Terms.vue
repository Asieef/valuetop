        <p class="text-sm">
            When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including
            information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on
            your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or
            products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how
            you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”.
            We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
            <br />
        <p>
            <br />– “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous
            unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
            http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
        </p>
        – “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type,
        Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
        – “Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the
        Site, along with basic user-demographic such as general location, age range, and gender, as is provided by
        connected social media websites.
        When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information
        and Order Information.
        <br />
        <br />HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
        <p>
            We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site
            (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices
            and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:</p>
        – Communicate with you;
        – Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and
        – When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising
        relating to our products or services.
        – Analyze our customer demographic to bring you better products and deals.
        – Create relevant marketing material for you and potential new customers.
        – Do market research to improve our shipping/RMA centers.
        We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular,
        your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics
        about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and
        advertising campaigns).
        <br />
        <br />SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
        <p>
            We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described

            Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to
            respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise
            protect our rights.</p>
        <br />
